# 🐮SOLID-DCA🐮

## Overview

solid-DCA is an automatic DCA protocol built on top of CowSwap. It allows users to execute a dollar-cost-average strategy in DeFi by means of streaming funds (via Superfluid) from the user's wallet into the protocol, unwrapping and executing CowSwap orders when a certain pre-established threshold (i.e. condition) is reached.

These actions are executed periodically thanks to Chainlink's automation tools (Chainlink Keepers).
